1 - its a BST
2 - height of (left-subtree - right-subtree) = {-1, 0, 1} 
know as balance factor

rotations: 
    ROOT -> R -> R (-2) = (left rotation)
    ROOT -> L -> L (-2) = (right rotation)
    ROOT -> R -> L (-2) = (right rotation(R) and left rotation(R))
    ROOT -> L -> R (-2) = (left rotation(L) and right rotation(L))
